# Store Trx

Store Trx is a learning project backend application built with **Golang** that provides APIs for managing user accounts, stores, products, and transactions. This project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern and uses **GORM** for database interactions, **JWT** for authentication, and **Gorilla Mux** for routing.
